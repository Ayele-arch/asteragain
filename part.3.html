    <h1>democracy and human right</h1>
<p> democracy and human rights is interdependent, intricate, mutually supportive and symbiotic − with some participants proposing <br> that the most appropriate term to
    use is ‘mutually constitutive’. Democracy cannot be defined without human rights. Human rights can be protected effectively only in a democratic state.
    The issue of sustainabilitywas also debated, with participants noting that human rights based democracycan take a long time to build up. 
    Nor is it a linear, cumulative process and itcan collapse easily.
    A creeping de-democratization can take the form of small adjustments though affecting important elements of political structures.</p>

         often the only organization left to engage and provide assistance in such situations, risking criticism either for interference in internal affairs or for tolerating unconstitutional
